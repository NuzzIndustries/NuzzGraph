*Determine whether to merge Properties and Relationships into one (no, but improve the API)
*Graph -> Show label
*Add "All Properties" property which gives all properties of inheritance chain

*Check which processes are running the DB, close xdesproc if it is running it
*Add RDF URI metadata to NodeTypes

*for sections that interact with the underlying DB.
