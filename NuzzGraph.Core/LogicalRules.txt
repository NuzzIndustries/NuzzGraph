I.

Given the following conditions: 
1. Two execution threads C1 and C2 access data property X at the time periods T1 and T2, spanning an interval Tdelta 
2. At some point Tchange between T1 and T2, the value of X is changed from X0 to X1 
3. Tdelta is below a threshold TOmega, where TOmega is the minimum interval which refreshing the value of X will be computationally resourceful. 

Then the following must be true:
The value of X0 must be applied to all threads which access X before TChange, and the value of X1 must be applied to all threads which access X after TChange 

Implications:
1. Updating the value of X must fire an event which propagates the value to cached instances
